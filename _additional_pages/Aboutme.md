I'm studying reverse engineering, and I'm also interested in system hacking. My goal is to become an all-rounder with a certain level of knowledge and skills in all four fields of system hacking, reverse engineering, web hacking, and cryptography by the time I graduate from university.

I enjoy wargaming, mostly on a site [DreamHack](https://dreamhack.io), and I'm a member of Team CyKor, participating in various CTFs to gain experience. Here is my DreamHack user [link](https://dreamhack.io/users/25740).
